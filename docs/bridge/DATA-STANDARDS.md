# Data Bridge v2 — Data Standards

> Phase 1 foundation document. Defines normalized columns, retention rules, and confidence scoring.

## Upload Types

| ID | Label | Default Tag | Notes |
|----|-------|-------------|-------|
| `code_violation` | Code Violation | Standard Code Violation | Retain open **and** closed records when address is usable |
| `water_shut_off` | Water Shut Off | Water Shut Off – High Value Distress Signal | All usable-address records are high-value distress signals |

## Normalized Columns

Every kept record is mapped to these fields (see `lib/bridge-intake-schema.js`):

| Field | Required | Source |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Street Address | Yes (for retention) | Parsed column or OCR |
| City | Yes | City profile selection (overrides file when missing) |
| State | Yes | City profile selection (overrides file when missing) |
| Zip | No | Parsed when available |
| Violation/Issue Type | No | Parsed column or inferred |
| Violation Date | No | Parsed when available |
| Description/Notes | No | Parsed free text |
| Distressed Signal Tag | Yes | Tagging engine |
| Matched Indicators | No | Semicolon-separated list when strong signals match |
| Confidence Level | Yes | `high`, `medium`, or `low` |
| Source File | Yes | Original upload filename |
| Upload Type | Yes | `code_violation` or `water_shut_off` |
| Processed At | Yes | ISO-8601 UTC timestamp |

## Retention Rules

**Keep** a row when:

- It has a usable street address after parsing/normalization
- For Code Violation uploads: status (open/closed) is **not** a filter — both are retained
- For Water Shut Off uploads: any record with a usable address is retained

**Discard** a row when:

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `no_address` | No usable street address after parsing |
| `blank_row` | Entirely empty or whitespace-only |
| `non_property` | Clearly non-property (e.g. "City Hall", "Parking Lot") |
| `duplicate` | Near-duplicate of another kept row in the same upload |
| `already_imported` | Address already exists in the user's Property Analyzer session |
| `parse_error` | Row could not be parsed from source |

## Usable Address Heuristic

An address is usable when:

1. Non-empty after trim
2. At least 4 characters
3. Contains a street number, or a parcel/unit indicator (`lot`, `parcel`, `unit`, `apt`, `suite`, `#`)
4. Matches basic street pattern (e.g. `123 Main`) or contains a numeric component

## Confidence Levels

| Level | When Applied |
|-------|--------------|
| `high` | Tabular parse with matched address column; OCR word confidence ≥ 85% |
| `medium` | Partial column match; OCR confidence 60–84%; inferred fields |
| `low` | OCR confidence < 60%; address inferred from weak text; flagged `needs_review` |

Low-confidence rows are **kept** when the address is usable, but flagged for user review in the results table.

## Deduplication

Within a single upload:

- Normalize addresses (lowercase, expand abbreviations, strip punctuation)
- Compare street addresses with Levenshtein similarity ≥ 0.92
- When issue types are present, require issue similarity ≥ 0.85 or exact match
- First occurrence is kept; later near-duplicates are discarded with reason `duplicate`

## Property Analyzer Cross-Reference

After deduplication, each kept row is checked against the logged-in user's Property Analyzer session (~10k+ imported leads). Rows that match an existing import are removed with reason `already_imported`.

**Index source (in order):**

1. `distressAnalyzerSession_LATEST.json` on disk (`PROPERTY_ANALYZER_PATH`) — preferred, no auth required
2. `GET /api/import-address-index` on the Property Analyzer service (fallback)

The index is cached for 5 minutes. Matching uses the same address similarity threshold as deduplication (≥ 0.92), comparing the composite key `streetAddress, city, state, zip`.

**Stats:** `alreadyImported` counts rows removed by this filter. `processingMeta.importIndexCount` reports how many addresses were in the Analyzer index at processing time.

## Property Analyzer Auto-Push

After processing, kept rows are **automatically appended** to the user's Property Analyzer session (`records[]`). Duplicates against existing `records` and `results` are skipped (same `email|phone|address` key).

- API: `POST /api/bridge-import-records` on Property Analyzer (Distress OS calls this server-side)
- Fallback: direct merge into `distressAnalyzerSession_LATEST.json` on disk if the API is unavailable
- Response field: `analyzerPush: { added, skipped, totalRecords, mode }`
- Bridge metadata on each record: `bridgeTag`, `bridgeIssueType`, `bridgeNotes`, `bridgeViolationDate`, `bridgeSourceFile`

Open Property Analyzer after a Bridge upload — new leads appear in the queue ready for **Start Analysis** without a manual spreadsheet upload.

## Response Received Timestamp (Turnaround KPI)

When attaching a processed list, the user must record **when the city actually sent the response** (date + time). This is separate from `attached_at` (when Data Bridge processed/stored the file).

| Field | Required on attach | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| `responseReceivedAt` | Yes | ISO-8601 datetime — when the city clerk/department delivered the list (email received, portal download, etc.) |

**Why:** Form Forge turnaround KPIs compare request submission time (`last_email_sent_at` / `last_online_submitted_at`) to `response_at` on the city profile. Without this field, attach would not update the tracker and averages would be wrong or missing.

**On attach, Data Bridge will:**

1. Persist `response_received_at` on the `bridge_datasets[]` version record
2. Call Form Forge `log_response()` for the mapped request type (`code_violation` or `water_shutoff`) with `response_status: "yes"` and the user-supplied datetime
3. Recompute `turnaround_days` on the city profile so `average_turnaround_days` in City Tracker reflects the entry

**Upload type → Form Forge request type:**

| Data Bridge `uploadType` | Form Forge `request_type` |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| `code_violation` | `code_violation` |
| `water_shut_off` | `water_shutoff` |

**Form Forge (Phase 6):** `log_response()` preserves full ISO datetime in `response_at` when the user supplies date+time. Date-only values remain supported for legacy entries. Turnaround still uses calendar-day diff via `compute_turnaround_days`.

## Versioned Attachment Schema

Stored on city profile as `bridge_datasets[]` (Form Forge `bridge_dataset.py`):

```json
{
  "id": "20260706-143022-arizona-marana",
  "upload_type": "code_violation",
  "upload_type_label": "Code Violation",
  "original_filename": "violations-march.xlsx",
  "response_received_at": "2026-07-04T09:42:00.000-07:00",
  "attached_at": "2026-07-06T14:30:22.000000+00:00",
  "kept_count": 142,
  "discarded_count": 8,
  "deduplicated_count": 3,
  "already_imported_count": 12,
  "csv_path": "data/bridge-datasets/Arizona/arizona-marana/20260706_bridge-code_violation.csv",
  "xlsx_path": "data/bridge-datasets/Arizona/arizona-marana/20260706_bridge-code_violation.xlsx",
  "meta_path": "data/bridge-datasets/Arizona/arizona-marana/20260706_bridge-code_violation-meta.json",
  "stats": { "kept": 142, "discarded": 8, "deduplicated": 3, "tagBreakdown": {} }
}
```

Files are stored under `data/bridge-datasets/{state}/{city_id}/`.

## Extension Points

- `UPLOAD_TYPES` registry in `bridge-intake-schema.js` — add new upload types without schema changes
- Property Analyzer cross-reference runs automatically during processing (Phase 5)
- `bridge_datasets[]` is append-only; new uploads create new versions without overwriting prior attachments
